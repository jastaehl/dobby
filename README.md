This repository is my little house elf. As long as I don't give it a sock by accident, it will serve me well.

### Initial idea for calendar sync:
__Challenge__: I work for 3+ companies at the same time. My "home" calendar is not accessible by people at these companies. So they cannot see my availabilities.
My "home" calendar receives all invites (I forward them manually).
Goal is to distribute all calendar entries that indicate I'm not available to all external calendars.

__Attempted solution__: using Google calendar API, set up a shadow calendar that contains a duplicate entry for all of your appointments.
All my external e-mail addresses who are not part of the original calendar entry are invited.
Like this, calendar entries can be synced to all external calendars.

__Why it did not work__: Most MS-based inboxes filter out automatically e-mails that look like they are generated by a bot.
Sender automatically set by Google Calendar API makes the messages look suspicious.

__Potential future solution__: Define sender of those API-generated e-mails (are there plans to support this?), automatically forward those e-mails from "home" e-mail address.
